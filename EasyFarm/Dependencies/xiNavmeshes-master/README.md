XiNavmeshes
==========

This contains all the navigational meshes generated by RecastNavigation. These
navmeshes will let mobs and player pets roam around like in retail. This will
also prevent aggro through walls.

## How to Install

* Pull the repo
* Copy contents of the `navmeshes` folder to `darkstar/navmeshes`
* Restart the game server

Navmeshes in `darkstar/navmeshes` are automatically loaded.
